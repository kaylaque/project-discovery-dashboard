The ""Plastractor"" is a device which shall extract microplastics from fluids easily via magnets. Therefore the bacterium Rhodospirillum rubrum ""magneticum"" was obtained. It is genetically modified to build magnetosomes; small magnetic and vesicle-like particles, with plastic binding peptides on its membrane. For modification we use E. coli BW29427 which transfers the needed plasmid to Rhodospirillum rubrum ""magneticum"" via conjugation. Two different plastic binding peptides are used, ""Tachystatin A2"" (TA2) and ""liquid chromatography peak I"" (LCI), fused with two different fluorescent proteins to enable the detection of the bound particles. Thus the device will be able to extract the plastics that are bound to magnetosomes and detect it by fluorescence.  ","['Lars Blank', 'Wolfgang Wiechert', 'Ulrich Schwaneberg', '', 'Henrik Horst', 'Alina Egger', 'Yasmin Kuhn', 'Jana Schnuch', 'benjamin skorupa', 'Jacqueline Riffel', 'Tobias Spiegl', 'Gereon Fischer', 'Julian Ahl', 'Rebekka Horstmann']"

Even with today’s technologies, improved efficacy is necessary as the demand for recombinant proteins is increasing – it has been estimated that within the next ten years half of all medicines developed will be biopharmaceuticals.    Our iGEM project introduces VibXPRESSO - Vibrio natriegens with Xtreme PRotein Expression and Secretion Optimization. We harness the gram-negative bacterium's generation time of under 10 minutes to rapidly produce large amounts of protein for efficient purification. This is achieved via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, that secretes proteins into the bacterium's periplasm. By environmental modifications we have increased the outer membrane leakiness of  V. natriegens, to direct proteins from the periplasm into the growth medium for easier protein harvest. As a proof of concept, we compared the yield of human growth hormone between V. natriegens WT ATCC 14048 and our modified VibXPRESSO strain.

However, the analyte binding antibodies in conventional immunoassays are randomly immobilized onto a test surface blocking some binding sites from the analytes. When the concentration of a disease marker as the analyte is below the detection limit or the sensitivity, the signal could be improved by orienting the antibodies. Our objective was to orientate a digoxigenin binding Fab fragment of the antibody by incorporating a p-azido-L-phenylalanine, an unnatural amino acid with click chemistry properties. As a control, we used a chemically treated Fab including azide in random locations. The Fabs were immobilized onto DBCO coated magnetic beads and the bound fluorescently labeled digoxigenin was measured with flow cytometry. According to the results, orientation improved the signal and made the test surface more homogeneous.

To combat these compounds, a novel methodology was designed for PAH and other hydrocarbon bioremediation from various catabolic pathways upstream of innocuous intermediates. Resulting intermediates are ultimately employed anaerobically to convert into dissolved hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen synthesis is also fueled by pathways that metabolize n-chained hydrocarbons. HORIZON 2.0 also utilizes pathways for the degradation of salicylate and phthalate, compounds that resulted from previous PAH degradation constructs but are unusable by E. coli. To modulate between the various conditions for degradation and synthesis, a positively regulated magnesium riboswitch and novel synthetic CRISPRi operators under riboswitch regulation were designed for use as synthetic operators. Ultimately, this project allows broad spectrum transformation of PAHs and other hydrocarbons within crude oil into usable energy.   ","['Ariel Haas', '', '', 'Christopher Caligiuri', 'Emily Kang', 'Andrew Gao', 'Sanjana Bollapragada', 'Jessica Lin', 'James Chang', 'Joanne Lee', 'Audrey Chyung', 'Mason Holmes', 'Alex Shahla', 'HanMin Kim', 'Ayush Agrawal']"

This causes drastic declines in bee populations, disrupting wild ecosystems and global agriculture. In this study, a primary CCD culprit, imidacloprid, is detoxified via paratransgenesis. Using this technique, the midgut bacteria of the bee are engineered to express a cytochrome p450, rendering the bee resistant to the insecticide. By attaching the reporter phoA to the insecticide-resistance gene, CYP6AY1, found in Nilaparvata lugens, the expression of the protein can be monitored. The signal sequence pelB is used to secrete the protein into the bee gut, where it can metabolize the imidacloprid. Once this system successfully functions in-vitro, the transgenic bacteria can be introduced to the bee orally and monitored for significant effects. We hypothesize that this treatment will increase the survival rate of A. mellifera when exposed to imidacloprid.

However, spider breeding is not applicable due to spider's fierce behavior. The current approach is to produce recombinant spidroins (silk proteins) from other chassis and spin them into silk. This year, we aim to manufacture recombinant spider silk with E.coli and color the silk for application in cloth industry. We modularized three significant domains of spidroin - the N-terminal, the repetitive region, and the C-terminal - and integrated them into various spidroin to form silk. We then dyed the silk with microbial natural pigments deoxyviolacein and indigo. To obtain better color and a more convenient dying process, we fused the repetitive region to chromoproteins and mixed them with spidroin during spinning. Our team hopes to provide a novel approach for cloth production and explore new possibilities for spider silk applications.

D-glutamate-rich γ-PGA is industrially produced by natural strain Bacillus species. D-glutamate degrades more slowly and L- glutamate has better biocompatibility. Therefore, γ-PGA with tailored L/D glutamate ratio is demanded for more diverse applications. By constructing the biobricks of γ-PGA synthase complex, 0.696 g/L L-glutamate-rich γ-PGA was accumulated in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Using the mathematical models based on the fermentation profile, the fermentation was optimized, and 15 times more γ-PGA was produced than that before. By introducing glutamate racemase gene racE under different Ptac promoter mutants, the L-glutamic acid content in γ-PGA varies from 97.1% to 36.9%.

However, because of the diversity of downstream GOI, the structures of the riboswitch are often unstable. So riboswitch cannot be considered as modular components.   This year, OUC-China aims to design modular riboswitch consisting of original riboswitch, stabilizer, and tuner from 5' to 3'. The stabilizer can stabilize the structure of the riboswitch. The tuner can reduce the expression probability of fusion protein and allow for predictable tuning. Then more tuners are designed to make diverse expression level. Finally, we use asRNA to change the on-off state of riboswitches.   All in all, we create modular riboswitch and introduce asRNA so that gene expression in engineered systems can be more easily regulated.

Microcystin is synthesized nonribosomally via microcystin synthetase encoded by the mcy genes. We have constructed plasmids where, after the promoter region, mcy genes are replaced with GFP genes. We would like to transform the plasmids into M. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli using shuttle plasmids. Upon addition of the transformed bacteria to wild-type M. aeruginosa cultures, we expect that the inserted GFP genes will be transcribed due to cell-to-cell communication. By taking samples from the growing cultures, we can determine the algae concentration which microcystin starts to be produced at.

Recently, it was discovered that the combination of choline and L-carnitine from red meat are converted to trimethylamine (TMA) in the body. TMA is a precursor to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which is found to exacerbate cholesterol buildup, ultimately leading to atherosclerosis. In this study, we targeted this pathway by breaking down the precursor, TMA, before TMAO is formed. A system designed to concurrently degrade TMA and subdue its toxic by-product, formaldehyde, was implemented in E. coli for these purposes. This system is composed of Trimethylamine Dehydrogenase (TMADH) and Formaldehyde Dehydrogenase (FDH) which are being tested independently for their degradation properties. Our approach has proven that TMADH is effective in TMA degradation and FDH can be expressed in a bacterial vector to minimize the presence of formaldehyde.   ","['maryann rall', '', '', 'Farrah Kaiyom', 'Allison J.

To increase competitiveness, we engineer yeast to accumulate high lipid levels by using light both as an inductor for metabolic switch and as an electron source. Further, yeast is designed to self-lyse after production. First, we introduce extra copies of lipid synthesizing enzymes controlled by light-inducible promoters. Next, we coat the cells with light-absorbing nanoparticles to enable the cells to use light as an electron source for NADPH formation – a critical cofactor for lipid synthesis. This leads to increased carbon flux to lipid production.

The origin of an implant-associated inflammation is often biofilms, which attach to the implant surface.  Targeted treatment of such bacterial biofilms is challenging. A typical therapeutic approach with antibiotics often fails. In the worst case, a generous removal of the region is mandatory.  Therefore, it would be helpful to detect the formation of a biofilm at an early stage, increasing the probability of successful treatment.  Our project aims to develop a sensor that makes this possible. The sensor is realized by genetically-engineered cells, which can recognize bacterial toxins and produce biomarkers as a response.  Throughout the development, we looked at our project from different points of view in conjunction with social and ethical aspects.

It is intended to serve as an interim treatment in a pandemic scenario that can be manufactured cheaply and quickly with limited lab access while a vaccine is developed. Using ensemble machine learning and differential evolution algorithms, we optimized anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody sequences to enhance binding affinity and therapeutic potential. We designed and computationally validated a novel DNA origami nanostructure to selectively deliver the optimized antibody sequences to immune cells for rapid antibody production in vivo. The high potency of the optimized antibodies and the specificity of DNA origami delivery reduce the minimum therapeutic dose, thereby reducing treatment cost.

Multifunctional engineering bacteria were cultured, with MerR-dependent hypersensitive switch, mercury monitor, and mercury stabilizer. Once mercury ions are found in the soil, multifunctional engineering bacteria scattered in the soil can be activated, releasing chromogenic protein and stabilizing mercury ions in the form of HgS with low toxicity. Moreover, considering engineering bacteria move slowly in the soil and is greatly affected by the environment, we choose earthworm as the walking carrier. The engineering bacteria will be reproduced in the earthworm body and move through soil followed with the earthworm to monitor and remedy mercury contaminated soil movably.

LanM was added to an ore leachate to form an REE-LanM complex. After isolation of this complex, REE ions were released by pH reduction. Upon removal of LanM, this biological chelator was regenerated and a highly pure REE solution was obtained. Our project is characterized by iterative process optimization tailoring the approach to industrial application. Overall, it was demonstrated that the protein LanM can replace current chemical chelating agents in REE mining.  ","['Martin Sieber', '', '', 'Alexander Schmatz', 'Friedrich J.

At least,150,000 members of our community are experiencing food insecurity. There are multiple causes of food insecurity including low household income and food deserts. We are addressing the problem by extending the shelf life of fresh produce so more members of our community have access to balanced meals. Our solution is the ChiFresh system composed of debit card-accessible refrigerators in areas with decreased access to fresh produce, a chitosan-based protective coating that extends the shelf life of fresh produce, and chitin-based packaging that is biodegradable. We focused on lowering the cost and environmental impact of chitin production.

While cut flowers are in high demand, they are ultimately treated as disposable products leading to large amounts of pre- and post-consumer waste. To make this intimate and essential relationship sustainable, iGEM Kyoto proposes a colorful palette of measures for each process from flower production to consumption. Our discussions with stakeholders revealed that many flowers are lost to insects or diseases. Accordingly, we attempted to kill pests with RNAi, and developed a virus detection device based on RT-LAMP and CRISPR-Cas12a. Alternative to chemicals, we suggest dsRNA and peptides to delay flower wilting. Notably, for more efficient syntheses of these eco-friendly materials, we proposed a system using asymmetric plasmid partitioning. Although fragility and mortality may add to a flower's beauty, an extended life span will allow them to be enjoyed by many.  ","['Makoto Kitabatake', 'Knut Woltjen', '', 'Rikuto Fukushima', 'Yutaro Ikeda', 'Yuto Ueda', 'Ryotaro Hirota', 'Chisato NISHIZAWA', 'Kaho Tanaka', 'Nao Tajima', 'Saki Kawakami', 'Taiyo Hayashi', 'Momoko Hayashida', 'Hiroto Koga', 'Yuki Kobayashi', 'Shiotsu Koudai', 'Kento Tamukai', 'Alexander Liu', 'Chihiro Goya', 'Ayumi Morita', 'Kazuyoshi Nakaji', 'Kaho Maeta', 'Hibiki Tamura', 'Ryusei Hayamatsu', 'Masaaki Shimazoe']"

However, the limitation and challenges still hinder its application to routine sample examination. In our project, we have created a Salmonella detector by introducing phi29 DNA polymerase gene into an isolated Salmonella phage genome through in vitro Tol2 transposon system. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) will be triggered in the presence of phi29 DNA polymerase generated by the reporter phage-infected Salmonella cells. The RCA products can be easily measured with a DNA-binding dye. Implementation in mathematical modeling and hardware design will help to understand the potential use in the real world.

The second component is induced by acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)mediated QS, activating PluxR,, which initiates the transcription of the xplA/B system. As a result, denitrification and ring-cleavage of RDX occurs, reducing the compound’s recalcitrance. A fluorescent reporter follows the catabolic component, allowing for quantification of biodegradation gene expression through fluorometry.

We use magnetic beads coated with single-stranded probe DNAs on which the target RNA acts as a primer for second-strand synthesis. The resulted dsDNA is the starting point of a transcription process in the same medium. The newly synthesised RNAs start the process again and again, thus producing a high amount of dsDNA detected by increasing SYBR Green fluorescence. We calibrated a simple fluorimeter and proposed a self-designed and 3D-printed adaptor for PCR tubes as inexpensive hardware for qualitative analysis. A software tool was also developed to create appropriate DNA-probe sequences for any small RNAs.

Globally over 6 million people suffer from IBD, and this number keeps rising. The current monitoring procedure for this disease lacks specificity, resulting in unnecessary follow-up examinations that are invasive, expensive, and time-consuming, which calls for an alternative procedure. Our solution, IBDetection, consists of a pill that can be ingested orally by the patient and delivers live, safe, genetically engineered Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) to the intestine. These bacteria include a biorthogonal sensing cascade to detect tetrathionate—an inflammation biomarker—with high specificity, and in turn activates translation of acoustic reporter genes, resulting in the formation of gas vesicles in the bacteria. These gas vesicles can then be measured outside of the body using conventional ultrasound equipment.

Low purine beer, therefore, can reduce the risk of beer drinkers suffering from gout. Meanwhile, oxidation in beer causes off-flavors and darkened color. Based on these problems, our team proposed to edit the yeast used in beer fermentation in order to produce a beer with low purine content and good antioxidant properties. We engineered the wild-type yeast by synthetic biology method such that the engineered yeast is able to produce and secrete three enzymes--purine nucleoside phosphorylase1 (PNP1), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and endochitinase (chit42). PNP1 can improve the utilization of purines, hence prevents purine accumulation in beer. The SOD1 and endochitinase will increase antioxidation in the final product.

Additionally, cattle naturally emit the potent greenhouse gas methane, contributing to global warming. Experts informed us that currently, no combined solution exists to both threats. Therefore we have developed Cattlelyst, a biofilter for cattle stalls targeting ammonia and methane emissions. Cattlelyst relies upon a synthetic co-culture of two non-pathogenic bacterial species that remove these harmful gasses. We modelled and established ammonia conversion in Pseudomonas putida alongside engineering Escherichia coli to consume methane. Containment of the bacteria in the biofilter is ensured by a combination of auxotrophy and two safety circuits.

The current method for early diagnosis of colorectal cancer remains as a big limitation. Previous reporters identified syndecan-2 (SDC2) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) were aberrantly methylated in Colorectal Cancer. Quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) for detecting methylated SDC2 and TFPI2 has been reported as an effective early screening method for colorectal cancer. Toehold switches are a class of RNAs with a hairpin loop that can be unfolded upon binding a trigger RNA for translation initiation of the reporter protein, which plays an important role in clinical diagnoses. In this study, we constructed a toehold plasmid and incubated it in the cell free protein expression system with methylated TFPI2 with a trigger sequence, which offers a non-invasive and visible approach for early detection of colorectal cancer in the future.

SchistoGONE introduces a novel, environmental approach to permanently ending schistosomiasis by exploiting the sporocyst stage of schistosoma residing in biomphalaria glabrata. SchistsoGONE starts with the biosynthesis of plant-based, anti-schistosomal compound sanguinarine using a 7 plasmid e.coli and W303 s.cerevisiae combination—an optimized biosynthesis pathway and insurance that environmental containment breach releases only benign substrates. Modified microorganisms are contained in specially designed plates situated by bodies of water that allow easy access for biomphalaria glabrata snails, naturally attracted to yeast.

Using computationally proposed mutations to the active site of the Ste2 GPCR in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we engineered Ste2 to recognize the kidney disease biomarker Cystatin-C instead of its native ligand. Evolutionary relationships were explored through pairwise alignments to identify binding residues with high Shannon entropy in Ste2. These target residues were computationally mutated to evolutionarily related amino acids to determine sets of mutations that optimized binding energy to Cystatin-C. To validate results, computationally-favorable mutations were induced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae upstream of mVenus to assess binding affinity between CARPE-mutated Ste2 and Cystatin-C.   ","['Jia Liu', '', '', 'Robert Shekoyan', 'Ani Srinivasan', 'Cody Chou', 'Arjun Batra', 'Aoi Otani', 'Alvira Tyagi', 'Amber Wei']"

Finding an effective way to scavenge free radicals is thought to be one of food and cosmetic industries.  Ergothioneine (EGT), a natural antioxidant, which is commonly found in mushrooms, has fairly powerful properties. However, human body cannot synthesize it, as a result, there is a huge market demand for the production of Ergothioneine. Our main goal is to achieve higher production of EGT. We engineered s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a chassis for the production of EGT. We applied CRISPR-Cas9 technology to integrate two genes into the yeast genome, and succeeded in constructing EGT biosynthesis pathway in S.cerevisiae.  Additionally, the production can be further improved after optimizing the media with proper concentration of amino acids, which is the precursor of EGT.

We hypothesized that forming Transcription Factor A Mitochondria (TFAM)-DNA complex in an aqueous solution supports DNA stability during data storage and retrieval. TFAM preserves DNA inside the mitochondria, acting as an adequate stabilizer. The TFAM-DNA complex was created with replicated human lung cDNA and purified TFAM protein.

When deployed in a co-culture system, the presence of these bacteria will allow microalgae to grow more efficiently on wastewater. Once sufficient algal biomass has been produced, the engineered bacteria can be triggered to move from an auxin-producing state to a phosphate-accumulating state, using a light-dependent genetic switch mechanism.

We subsequently integrated this pathway in B. subtilis, to engineer a cholesterol-lowering probiotic able to prevent intestinal cholesterol absorption. The pathway consists of ismA, a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from the bacterium, E. coprostanoligenes, and two repurposed sterol-metabolizing enzymes from humans.

Addressing this gap, we have built a portable, plasmonic biosensor-based device using the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) that produce wavelength extinction shifts via a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) signal. The LSPR chip, viewed under a UV/Vis Spectrometer, provides absorbance signals to confirm the detection of our peptides of interest.

We have developed a  PoC biosensor that consists of a multiplex lateral flow assay for easy semiquantitative results. The design involves 2 different aptamers for each biomarker, in order to create a sandwich assay able to detect each protein. By creating this geroscience tool we want to empower the health sector and civil society to promote a healthy aging culture.

To overcome these shortcomings, we designed !MPACT: a Modular and Personalized Autoimmune Cell Therapy. The design was made together with relevant stakeholders, a proof-of-concept was developed in the laboratory, and a kinetic model was built. We engineered mammalian cells that detect the autoantibodies (ANCAs) and subsequently produce the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, which results in suppression of the autoimmune response. The activity of !MPACT depends on the ANCA concentration, hence, it adjusts to the disease activity, leading to fewer side effects than current therapies, preventing relapses, and reducing healthcare expenditures and workloads. The modularity of the used technology offers great potential to treat many autoimmune diseases.

MonChassis is overcoming current limitations by increasing precursor availability in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica by metabolic engineering, compartmentalization, and creating a cell-free, electrically-driven CYP system to circumvent product toxicity. With this, we established an adaptable platform for monoterpenoid production, allowing further deployment of monoterpenoids in unexplored areas. As a proof-of-concept , we produced verbenone, used to fight bark beetle invasion in forests locally, and globally. Thereby, MonChassis not only establishes a flexible production method for monoterpenoids without using plants but also contributes to the conservation of forests.   ","['Jochen Schmid', '', 'Moritz Gansbiller', 'Boje Müller', 'Theresa Wörmann', 'Louis Noel Schanzmann', 'Marius Luttermann', 'Vincent Kaltenbach', 'Antonia Louise Irion', 'Karla Schönfeldt', 'Erik Schüftan', 'Hendrik Franke', 'Benedikt Kuhs ', 'Florian Muhs', 'Sally Scherm', 'Sophie Sedlacek', 'Carina Kuestner', 'Simon Nimphius', 'Michel Westermann', 'Cara Sophie Jaeckel', 'Felix Heumesser', 'Lasse Middendorf', 'Henrike Anna Brandt', 'Tobias Bröker', 'Mona Lippelt', 'Helen Ewald', 'Marvin Albers', 'Meliawati Meliawati', 'Giulia Ravagnan', 'Maximilian Zander', 'Jos Cox']"

Among these challenges, the Deformed wing virus (DWV), primarily transmitted by mites, is particularly widespread and detrimental, causing the death of millions of bees annually. The Estonia-TUIT team aims to suppress viral protein expression within bee cells by inducing RNA interference response. Our strategy involves genetically modified yeast cells producing short hairpin RNAs, which inhibit DWV gene expression. To deliver these shRNAs into bee cells, we intend to either feed our modified yeast to bees or directly inject shRNA-containing extracts into honeycombs. This approach aims to boost the bee's inherent RNA interference immune response, protecting them from the virus's harmful effects.  ","['Ilona Faustova', 'Mart Loog', '', 'Artemi Maljavin', 'Sviatoslav-Oleh Savchak', 'Davit Rizhinashvili', 'Aleksandrs Rebriks', 'Dmytro Fedorenko', 'Frida Matiyevskaya', 'Stepan Strelchenko ', 'Viacheslav Kiselev', 'Juli Mukhadze', 'Jūlija Grigorjeva ', 'Nargiz Mammadzada', 'Olesia Buldakova', 'Kateryna Chaharna', 'Roza Rostam Nejad', 'Ekaterina Sedykh', 'Veronika Podliesnova ', 'Mykhailo Lytvynenko', 'Ulyana Chuduk', 'Mariya Roy', 'Nastassia Shtaida', 'Mihkel Örd']"

A primary challenge lies in degrading PFAS, given the highly stable carbon-fluorine bonds present in their structure. The project aims to enhance the enzymatic activity of dehalogenases isolated from Delfia acidovorans for the degradation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Utilizing a fluoride-sensitive riboswitch linked to the expression of green fluorescent protein, we can effectively measure enzymatic activity and thus assess the enzymatic activity of the optimized dehalogenases. Through computational modeling, we have predicted the protein structures and optimized binding pockets for PFOA and other PFAS. These predictions were compared to variants from a dehalogenase mutant library generated using error-prone PCR.  Collaboration with local water treatment facilities has tailored our project to real-life applications, paving the way for potential advancements in PFAS bioremediation strategies.    ","['Lin Lin', 'Michele Fabris', 'Anna Olivia Zier Jeppesen', 'Florian Pruckner', 'Jacob Fredegaard Hansen', 'Moritz Schaefer', 'Tina Kronborg', 'Catharina Bang Jensen', 'Annabell Hannibalsen', 'Christina Sofie Olesen', 'Clara Friis Vangsgaard', 'Joan Falandysz Skřtt', 'Viktor Manuel Grunddal Larsen', 'Lina Malou Sörensen', 'Maja Lindskov Jessen', 'Maria Bjerregaard', 'Sofie Moebes', 'Signe Heegaard Hundborg', 'Maja R.

As antibiotics have been used increasingly over the past century, resistance to these life-saving medicines grows exponentially. Phage therapy offers an exciting alternative. Using phage ΦEa104, the phage was attempted to be optimized to attack the fire blight bacteria. Then an essential gene would be deleted to ensure the phage does not attack other microbes in the environment. Viral infection of liquid cultures was effectively induced to generate viral lysate for genomic extraction. The bacteria and phage were not compatible by way of current experimental design methods in terms of safety protocols. This investigation elucidated potential new target sites, replacements for pesticides, and ideas for biocontainment tactics against microbial attacks. Ultimately, cloning techniques, genomic extraction, and the power of homologous recombination have the potential to eliminate Erwinia amylovora as a threat.  ","['Ian Ehrenreich', '', '', 'Vidur Mushran', 'Nicolette Romo-Zelada', 'Daniela Gioia', 'Omar Salah ', 'Monica Rodriguez', 'Kenneth Phung', 'Qian (Karissa) Yan', 'kelsey meador', 'Scott Rankin', 'Benjamin Tran']"

By applying quorum quenching organisms capable of degrading AHL signals, the communication among bacteria can be hindered, effectively disrupting the production of PCWDEs. Additionally, the utilization of the aiiA gene encoding AHL lactonase allows for the degradation of AHL signaling molecules, further halting PCWDE production. This research project aims to protect orchid viability and agricultural productivity by offering a promising approach to combat Dickeya fangzhongdai. The findings have significant implications for orchid cultivation and provide insights into effective disease management strategies in agricultural settings.        ","['DR.
